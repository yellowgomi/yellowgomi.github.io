Unfinished.

This is just a post of meaningless introspection.

I woke up 12 PM today, with an aching head (probably from lack of caffeine) and a huge amount of disgust at myself. This is quite unusual. I haven't felt anything like this for a while.

Technically speaking, I haven't felt depressed since the fourth year at college.

I remember being exhausted every midnight, and waking up the same five or six hours later in the morning. As a matter of fact, that's almost the only thing I remember for sure from those years. The rest of my memory seems vague, and unreal, like looking down at someone strangling themselves and feeling indifferent, only that I know I'm actually looking at myself.

The only way I keep track of the past is through chat history, diary, and Internet footprints.

As much as I'd like to think the past is past, it's never gone for long. These flashbacks, they come back when they're least expected. Like when I'm doing dishes.

I watched the foam swirling and disappear in the sink when a small ripple of contentment crept over my heart, slow yet steady. I've always realized that I easily get enjoyment from simple, repetitive tasks--one notable symptom of the Asperger syndrome--but it recently occurred to me that it's also a signal of mediocrity.

To admit one's mediocrity is one thing, to live with it another. I've known for years that I am at best just medium talent, but it's still hard to make peace with it.
